KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXACT MATCHES:
- The Experimental Explorer: Both systems assigned exactly 200 companies

CLOSE MATCHES (within 5%):
- The Traditionalist: 2 company difference
- The Operational Scaler: 3 company difference

SIGNIFICANT VARIANCES:
- The Structured Builder: ML v2 assigned 53 fewer companies (-42.4%)
- The AI-Driven Leader: ML v2 assigned 58 more companies (+386.7%)

INTERPRETATION:
The ML v2 model identified significantly more "AI-Driven Leaders" (73 vs 15)
and fewer "Structured Builders" (72 vs 125) compared to the database 
assignments. This suggests:

1. The ML v2 rank-based approach may be more generous in identifying top 
   performers, as it guarantees equal distribution of the 5 archetypes
   
2. The database assignments appear to have a concentration in the middle tier
   (Structured Builder: 125 companies, 25% of total)
   
3. ML v2's unsupervised clustering found natural groupings that differ from
   the rule-based or manual assignments in the database

METHODOLOGY DIFFERENCE:
- Database: Uses predefined rules/thresholds or manual assignment
- ML v2: Uses K-Means clustering with rank-based mapping to ensure all 5
  strategic levels are represented proportionally
