QUESTION 13
================================================================================
Question Text (DB): How rigorously does your organization validate the technical and regulatory feasibility of an AI use case before committing resources?
Type: Statement

--- DATABASE ANSWERS (5) ---
ID 67: 'Minimal / Unsure � We do not have a formal feasibility check; projects are often started based on excitement or intuition without verifying data or compliance requirements first.'
ID 68: 'Reactive Assessment � We perform basic checks only after a project has started, often leading to delays or "stuck" projects when data or legal issues unexpectedly emerge.'
ID 69: 'Basic Due Diligence � We have an informal "Pre-Check" for major projects where we verify if the necessary data exists and if there are obvious legal hurdles.'
ID 70: 'Structured Validation � We use a clear "Go/No-Go" process for every use case that validates data readiness, process alignment, and regulatory compliance before any budget is released.'
ID 71: 'Optimized Strategic Filtering � We use a standardized, data-driven validation engine that ensures every initiative is perfectly aligned with business goals, technical capabilities, and compliance standards from the start.'

QUESTION 18
================================================================================
Question Text (DB): How structured is your approach to planning, implementing, and delivering AI-related projects?

Type: Statement

--- DATABASE ANSWERS (5) ---
ID 92: 'Undefined / Ad-hoc � We do not have a set process for AI projects; tasks are handled as they arise without formal planning or clear ownership.'
ID 93: 'Individual Initiative � Project delivery depends on the effort of specific individuals; while some projects succeed, we lack a repeatable "playbook" for the whole team.'
ID 94: 'Basic Standardization � We use a consistent workflow (e.g., simple task tracking or weekly sprints) that allows us to manage AI projects with predictable timelines.'
ID 95: 'Targeted & Results-Oriented � We use a process specifically adapted for AI (e.g., early prototyping and data-readiness checks), ensuring we don't waste resources on unfeasible ideas.'
ID 96: 'High-Velocity Delivery � Our implementation engine is highly efficient; we can rapidly move from a "Proof of Concept" to a live tool with minimal friction and clear ROI tracking.'
