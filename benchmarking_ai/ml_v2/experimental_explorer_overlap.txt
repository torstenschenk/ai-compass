COMPANY-LEVEL OVERLAP ANALYSIS: "The Experimental Explorer" Cluster
================================================================================
Generated: 2026-01-16
Analysis: Detailed comparison of company assignments between ML v2 and Database

================================================================================

SUMMARY STATISTICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ML v2 Total Companies:          200
Database Total Companies:       200
Overlapping Companies:          194 (97.0%)
Companies Only in ML v2:        6 (3.0%)
Companies Only in Database:     6 (3.0%)

================================================================================

KEY FINDING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite both systems assigning exactly 200 companies to "The Experimental 
Explorer" cluster, they are NOT the same 200 companies.

✓ 194 companies (97%) are consistently assigned to this cluster by both systems
✗ 12 companies (6%) differ in their assignments

This indicates strong but not perfect agreement between the ML v2 unsupervised
clustering approach and the database's rule-based/manual assignment method.

================================================================================

DETAILED BREAKDOWN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPANIES ONLY IN ML v2 (6 companies):
Company IDs: 9, 112, 316, 429, 852, 1157

These companies were assigned to "The Experimental Explorer" by the ML v2 
model but were assigned to a different cluster in the database.

COMPANIES ONLY IN DATABASE (6 companies):
Company IDs: 150, 972, 975, 1050, 1056, 1072

These companies were assigned to "The Experimental Explorer" in the database
but were assigned to a different cluster by the ML v2 model.

================================================================================

INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HIGH AGREEMENT (97%):
The 97% overlap demonstrates strong consistency between the two methods. This
suggests that:
- Both systems identify similar patterns in company data
- The "Experimental Explorer" archetype has relatively clear boundaries
- ML v2's unsupervised approach validates the database assignments

MINOR DISCREPANCIES (3%):
The 6 companies that differ in each direction likely represent:
- Edge cases near cluster boundaries
- Companies with mixed characteristics spanning multiple archetypes
- Differences between ML v2's multi-dimensional distance-based clustering
  and the database's rule-based thresholds

METHODOLOGY COMPARISON:
- ML v2: Uses K-Means to find natural groupings in 7-dimensional space,
  then maps clusters to archetypes via rank-based assignment
- Database: Likely uses predefined score thresholds or manual classification
  based on business rules

The high overlap validates both approaches while the small differences 
highlight the value of ML v2's data-driven boundary detection.

================================================================================

RECOMMENDATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 97% agreement rate is excellent and suggests that:

1. The ML v2 model is performing well and aligning with domain expertise
2. The 12 differing companies should be reviewed to understand if they are
   truly edge cases or if one method is more accurate
3. This level of agreement supports using ML v2 for automated, scalable
   cluster assignment while maintaining confidence in the results
