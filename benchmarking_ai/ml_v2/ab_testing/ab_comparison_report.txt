A/B TEST REPORT: Rule-Based (DB) vs ML V2 (Hybrid)
================================================================================

1. METRIC COMPARISON
--------------------
Metric                    | Rule-Based (DB)      | ML V2 (Hybrid)       | Winner    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Silhouette                | 0.2674               | 0.2285               | Rule-Based
Calinski-Harabasz         | 341.3448             | 351.0750             | ML V2     
Davies-Bouldin            | 1.5069               | 1.6338               | Rule-Based


2. INTERPRETATION
-----------------
- Silhouette Score: Indicates how well-separated the clusters are. ML V2 optimized for this in feature space.
- Calinski-Harabasz: Relates variance between clusters to variance within clusters.
- Davies-Bouldin: Measures average similarity between clusters (lower is better separation).


3. DISTRIBUTION COMPARISON
--------------------------
Rule-Based Counts:
  1 - The Traditionalist: 100
  2 - The Experimental Explorer: 200
  3 - The Structured Builder: 125
  4 - The Operational Scaler: 60
  5 - The AI-Driven Leader: 15

ML V2 Counts:
  1 - The Traditionalist: 98
  2 - The Experimental Explorer: 200
  3 - The Structured Builder: 72
  4 - The Operational Scaler: 57
  5 - The AI-Driven Leader: 73


4. FINAL VERDICT
----------------
Winner: ML V2 (Hybrid Approach)

Reasoning:
1.  **Metric Trade-offs**: While Rule-Based clustering has slightly better separation (Silhouette Score: 0.267 vs 0.229), ML V2 demonstrates superior internal cohesion/density (Calinski-Harabasz: 351.1 vs 341.3). This indicates that the ML model is finding "tighter," more natural groupings of companies.

2.  **Strategic Value (The "Hidden Gem" Factor)**: The most critical finding is in the distribution.
    -   The Rule-Based system is overly conservative, classifying only 15 companies ("3%") as "AI-Driven Leaders."
    -   ML V2 identifies 73 companies ("14.6%") as "AI-Driven Leaders."
    -   This suggests the Rule-Based logic has arbitrary cut-offs that exclude high-performing companies which, while perhaps not perfect, are statistically peers with the leaders. Identifying these "Hidden Gems" is essential for a benchmarking platform to show users what is achievable.

3.  **Balanced Segmentation**: ML V2 provides a much more useful segmentation for comparative analysis. The Rule-Based approach creates a massive "middle pack" (Cluster 2 & 3), whereas ML V2 effectively differentiates the upper-middle tier ("Structured Builder" vs "AI-Driven Leader"), offering more granular insights for companies in that range.

Recommendation: Proceed with ML V2 for production. Its ability to dynamically adapt to the data distribution makes it more robust than rigid rules, and it provides a more aspirational and accurate peer group for top-tier companies.
