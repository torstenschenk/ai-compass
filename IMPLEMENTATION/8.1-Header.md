Executive Results Dashboard Header
1. Content & Wording (Copywriting)
Main Page Header: "AI Compass: Executive Results Report".
Introductory Text: "Welcome to your AI Evolution Blueprint—a data-driven synthesis of your organizational maturity, competitive standing, and the strategic path forward to scaling measurable AI value.".
Data Card 1 (Score):
Label: "Total Overall Score".
Value: "2.6/5".
Data Card 2 (Cluster):
Label: "Company Cluster".
Value: "The Structural Builder".
Data Card 3 (Benchmark):
Label: "Percentile".
Value: "Top 32% in Manufacturing".

2. Design & UI Specifications (Nano Banana Style)
Typography: Bold, high-contrast sans-serif for titles and scores; medium-weight slate gray for labels.
Layout: A centered hero section followed by a balanced 3-column grid.
Card Aesthetics: * Background: Clean white (#FFFFFF) with rounded corners (12px–16px).
Shadow: Subtle "soft-depth" shadow to separate cards from the light-gray/blue background.
Iconography:
Card 1 Icon: Blue ribbon/medal icon in a rounded-square blue container.
Card 2 Icon: Purple people/group icon in a rounded-square purple container.
Card 3 Icon: Blue-indigo growth chart icon in a rounded-square indigo container.

3. Technical Requirements (MVP Implementation)
Dynamic Data Injection: The component must fetch and display values calculated from the backend scoring engine (Overall Score, Cluster Name, and Sector Percentile).
Responsive Grid: Use a Flexbox or CSS Grid container that displays 3 columns on desktop and stacks into 1 column on mobile devices.
Accessibility: Ensure icons have descriptive aria-labels and that text contrast meets WCAG standards for readability.
