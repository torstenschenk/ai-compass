Use the following code to create the results page:

import { Navigation } from './Navigation';
import { ResultsHero } from './ResultsHero';
import { ClusterProfile } from './ClusterProfile';
import { MaturityProfile } from './MaturityProfile';
import { GapAnalysis } from './GapAnalysis';
import { Roadmap } from './Roadmap';
import { ExpertConsultation } from './ExpertConsultation';
import { DownloadCTA } from './DownloadCTA';
import { Footer } from './Footer';

export function ResultsPage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-white">
      <Navigation />
      <ResultsHero />
      <ClusterProfile />
      <MaturityProfile />
      <GapAnalysis />
      <Roadmap />
      <ExpertConsultation />
      <DownloadCTA />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}

## Results Page (Analysis and Recommendations) — MVP Spec

### 1) Goal
Receive instant analysis on AI readiness and provide an immediate roadmap and action plan.

### 2) Data Source (Single Source of Truth)
- `GET /api/v1/responses/{response_id}?token={access_token}`

**Response must include (minimum)**
- Company: `company_name`, `industry`, `number_of_employees`, optional `website`, `city`
- Response meta: `response_id`, `created_at`
- Scores:
  - `total_score` (display value: **2.6/5**)
  - `cluster` object:
    - `cluster_id`
    - `cluster_name` (e.g., "The Structured Builder")
  - `percentile` + `benchmark_context` (e.g., "Top 32% in Manufacturing")
- Dimension scores (7): dimension_name + score (1–5)
  - Computed from `response_items` joined with `questions`, `answers`, `dimensions`
- Peer benchmark data:
  - Average dimension scores across all responses (optionally filtered by industry)
- Roadmap + recommendations payload (LLM or fallback)
- PDF availability: `pdf_url` or a flag to enable the download button

### 3) Page Layout (UI Components)
Order and presence are fixed for MVP:

1) **Navigation** (2-Navigation.md)
2) **Header (Executive Results Dashboard Header)** (8.1-Header.md)
   - Title + subtitle
   - 3 data cards:
     - Total Overall Score (**2.6/5**)
     - Company Cluster (dynamic name from `cluster_profiles`)
     - Percentile (dynamic, includes industry context from `companies.industry`)
3) **Cluster Profile Visualization** (8.2-Cluster-Profile.md)
   - 5-bar chart (low → high)
   - Active cluster highlighted (from `responses.cluster_id`)
   - Description cards (active one highlighted)
4) **Multi-Dimensional Radar Chart** (8.3-Multi-Dimensional-Radar-Chart.md)
   - 7 dimensions (Strategy, People, Data, Use Cases, Processes, Compliance, Tech)
   - Compare Your Company vs Peer Benchmark (all responses in DB on average)
5) **Strategic Gap Analysis**  (8.4-Strategic-Gap-Analysis.md)
6) **Roadmap** (8.5-Roadmap.md)
7) **Expert Consultation & Next Steps** (8.6-Expert-Consultation.md)
8) **Download Report (PDF only)** (8.7-Download-Report.md)
9) **Footer** (3-Footer.md)

### 4) Data Computation (Response-Centric)

All results are computed from the `response_id`:

**User Scores:**
- Derived from `response_items` table
- Joined with `answers` (for answer_level/answer_weight)
- Joined with `questions` (for question weight)
- Joined with `dimensions` (for dimension weight)
- Aggregated per dimension and overall

**Peer Benchmark:**
- Computed from ALL `responses` in database
- Average dimension scores across the dataset
- Optionally filtered by industry (from `companies.industry`)
- Provides comparison baseline

**Cluster:**
- Active cluster from `responses.cluster_id`
- Cluster metadata from `cluster_profiles` table (5 clusters: score ranges 1-5)

**Percentile:**
- Computed dynamically by comparing this response's `total_score` against all responses
- Industry context included if filtering by industry

### 5) Behavior (MVP)
- Page loads by `response_id` + token
- All charts render with data from response-centric queries
- Download button calls:
  - `GET /api/v1/responses/{response_id}/pdf?token={access_token}`

### 6) Outcome
User sees "where we are" and "what to do next" without ambiguity, all derived from their response data and peer comparisons.
