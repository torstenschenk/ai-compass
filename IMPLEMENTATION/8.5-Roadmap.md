**1. Content & Wording**
The roadmap serves as the "Prescription" following the "Diagnosis." The tone is actionable, chronological, and highly personalized.
Component Header:
Headline: AI-Compass: "Next Best Action" Roadmap
Sub-headline: Your personalized pathway to maturity, based on successful "Lookalike" trajectories and critical gap resolution.
Phase 1: Foundation (0-3 Months)
Focus: Cultural alignment and strategic bedrock.
Mandatory Inclusion (from Gap Analysis): "Initiate AI Literacy & Change Management Program to bridge the Talent Gap.
"Actionable Step: Establish a cross-functional AI Steering Committee.
Phase 2: Implementation (3-9 Months)Focus: Scaling infrastructure and delivering use cases.
Success Trajectory Item: "Deploy the first Pilot Use Case identified in the k-NN Peer Benchmark (e.g., Automated Customer Support).
"Actionable Step: Implement a centralized Data Access Layer for AI experimentation.
Phase 3: Optimization (9+ Months)
Focus: Sustainable governance and process automation.
Mandatory Inclusion (from Gap Analysis): "Formalize the AI Code of Conduct and Governance Framework to ensure long-term EU AI Act compliance.
"Actionable Step: Integrate AI-driven performance tracking into core business processes.

**2. Design & UI Specifications**
The UI must visualize a journey, moving from left to right or top to bottom, using a clear timeline metaphor.
Layout:
Timeline Track: A vertical or horizontal "Roadmap Path" with three distinct nodes representing the Phases.
Phase Containers: Distinct cards for each phase, utilizing a "Step-by-Step" numbering system (Step 01, 02, 03).
Visual Elements:
Connectors: Dotted or solid lines connecting the phase nodes to indicate progression.
Highlighting "Must-Win" Battles: Recommendations derived from the Strategic Gap Analysis should be marked with a "Priority" badge or a different border color (e.g., the Critical Red from the Gap Analysis).
Color Palette:
Phase 1 (Light Blue): Representing clarity and beginning.
Phase 2 (Deep Blue): Representing action and depth.
Phase 3 (Purple/Violet): Representing maturity and integration.
Interactive Elements: Hover states on each recommendation that reveal a "Why this matters" tooltip (linking back to the k-NN or Gap logic).

**3. Technical Requirements (MVP Implementation)**
The "Recommendation Engine" must synthesize the Gap Analysis and the k-NN Peer Group data.
Success Trajectory Engine (k-NN Logic):
Query: Search the database for companies with a maturity score $\text{User Score} \times 1.25$.
Extraction: Identify the "Checklist Items" that these lookalikes have completed which the user is still missing.
Ranking: Select the two most common "completed" items from the peer group to populate Phase 2 and 3.
Mandatory Injection Logic:
Trigger: The system must pull the Item_IDs identified in the Strategic Gap Analysis.
Placement: * If the gap is "People/Culture," inject it into Phase 1.
If the gap is "Governance/Technical," inject it into Phase 3.
Phasing Algorithm:
Categorize all potential recommendations into a Tag_Library (e.g., Tag: Foundation, Tag: Implementation, Tag: Optimization).
Ensure the output generates exactly one (1) "Must-Win" Battle and at least one (1) "Peer-Based" recommendation per phase.
Data Integrity: Ensure that no recommendation suggested in the Roadmap is already marked as "Complete" in the user's initial checklist.
