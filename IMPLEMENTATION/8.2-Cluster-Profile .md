AI Maturity Cluster Visualization

1. Content & Wording (Copywriting)
Main Header: "Your Cluster Profile: [Dynamic Cluster Name]"
Sub-headline: "A high-level synthesis of the company's current state."
Axis Labels:
Y-Axis: "Value Growth ↑" (Positioned vertically along the left axis).
X-Axis: "AI Maturity →" (Positioned horizontally along the bottom axis).
Cluster Descriptions (Bottom Cards):
The Traditionalist: AI is not yet a topic of discussion. Operations are predominantly manual, data is siloed or analog, and there is often significant cultural skepticism.
The Curious Experimenter: The organization has started "playing" with AI through isolated tools like ChatGPT. There is curiosity but no formal strategy or oversight.
The Structured Builder: A solid technical and strategic foundation is being laid. High-level roadmaps and cloud infrastructure are in place, but scaling remains difficult.
The Value Scaler: AI is delivering measurable ROI. Leadership is aligned, and the organization is moving multiple use cases into production.
The AI-Enabled Leader: AI is a core strategic pillar. The workforce is highly literate, data flows are automated, and the company sets industry standards.

2. Design & UI Specifications
Chart Style: A bar chart with 5 bars increasing in height from left to right (equal horizontal distribution).
Labels inside Bars: Replace numbers with the Cluster Names (vertical or horizontal text depending on space).
State Highlighting:
Inactive Clusters: Soft gray/blue-gray gradient (bg-slate-200).
Active (K-Means Result): Vibrant Blue-to-Purple gradient (bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-600).
Description Cards: Clean white cards below the chart. The active cluster's card should be highlighted with a border or background glow to match the chart bar.

3. Technical Requirements (MVP Implementation)
K-Means Integration: The activeCluster index (1–5) must be determined by the K-Means clustering logic from the backend assessment answers.
Axis Placement: Labels must be anchored to the axes (Left and Bottom), not floating at the top of the container.
Incremental Growth: Bars must be programmatically scaled (e.g., Level 1 = 20% height, Level 5 = 100% height).
