AI Maturity Cluster Visualization

## 1) Content & Wording (Copywriting)

**Main Header**
- **Your Cluster Profile: {cluster_name}**
  - Data source: `cluster_profiles.cluster_name` via `responses.cluster_id`

**Sub-headline**
- **A high-level synthesis of the company's current state.**

**Axis Labels**
- **Y-Axis (left, vertical):** Value Growth ↑
- **X-Axis (bottom, horizontal):** AI Maturity →

---

## 2) Cluster Bar Chart (5 bars)

**Chart style**
- 5 bars, equal width, distributed left → right
- Bar heights increase left → right (visual "growth curve")

**Bar labels**
- Each bar shows the **cluster name** (not numbers)
  - Orientation: vertical text if space is tight, otherwise horizontal

**State highlighting**
- **Inactive clusters:** soft gray / blue-gray (e.g., `bg-slate-200`)
- **Active cluster:** vibrant gradient `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-600`
  - Active cluster determined from `responses.cluster_id`

**Incremental growth (heights)**
- Programmatic mapping (example):
  - Cluster 1 = 20%
  - Cluster 2 = 40%
  - Cluster 3 = 60%
  - Cluster 4 = 80%
  - Cluster 5 = 100%

## 3) Cluster Description Cards (below chart)

**Layout**
- 5 cards below the chart (responsive grid)
- Each card contains:
  - **Title:** Cluster name
  - **Description:** Text below

**Active card highlighting**
- The active cluster's card is visually emphasized using:
  - border highlight and/or subtle glow matching the active bar gradient

**Cluster Descriptions**
(Retrieved from `cluster_profiles` table)

- **The Traditionalist:** AI is not yet a topic of discussion. Operations are predominantly manual, data is siloed or analog, and there is often significant cultural skepticism.
- **The Curious Experimenter:** The organization has started "playing" with AI through isolated tools like ChatGPT. There is curiosity but no formal strategy or oversight.
- **The Structured Builder:** A solid technical and strategic foundation is being laid. High-level roadmaps and cloud infrastructure are in place, but scaling remains difficult.
- **The Value Scaler:** AI is delivering measurable ROI. Leadership is aligned, and the organization is moving multiple use cases into production.
- **The AI-Enabled Leader:** AI is a core strategic pillar. The workforce is highly literate, data flows are automated, and the company sets industry standards.

## 4) Technical Requirements (MVP Implementation)

**Backend-driven active cluster**
- Active cluster ID from `responses.cluster_id` (range: **1–5**)
- UI must map active cluster to:
  - active bar
  - active description card
  - dynamic header cluster name

**Data source**
- GET `/api/v1/responses/{response_id}?token=...` must provide:
  - `cluster_id` (int 1–5) - from `responses.cluster_id`
  - `cluster_name` (string) - from `cluster_profiles.cluster_name`
  - Full list of all 5 cluster profiles for rendering cards

**Axis placement**
- Axis labels must be anchored:
  - Y-axis label attached to left side (vertical)
  - X-axis label attached to bottom (horizontal)
- Not placed as "floating text" above the chart container

**Fallback behavior**
- If `cluster_id` is NULL (response not yet completed):
  - Default highlight: none
  - Header: `Your Cluster Profile: Not available`
  - Cards render normally without emphasis
