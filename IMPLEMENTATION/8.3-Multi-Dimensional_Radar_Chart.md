Multi-Dimensional Radar Chart
1. Content & Wording (Optimized Copy)
Main Header: "The Multi-Dimensional Maturity Profile"
Sub-headline: "A high-fidelity visualization comparing your organizational performance across 7 core dimensions against the industry average."
The 7 Dimensions: Strategy, People, Data, Use Cases, Processes, Compliance, Tech.
Legend: * Your Company: Represented by the Red Area/Line.
Peer Benchmark: Represented by the Blue Area/Line (Average of 500+ companies).

2. Design & UI Specifications (Nano Banana Style)
Chart Type: Radar (Spider) Chart.
Color Palette:
User Data: Soft Red stroke with a semi-transparent red fill (rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.2)).
Benchmark Data: Soft Blue stroke with a semi-transparent blue fill (rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.2)).
Grid Style: Circular or polygonal concentric rings (scales 1 to 5) in light gray.
Typography: Labels positioned outside the chart perimeter in a clean, professional Sans-Serif font (Charcoal/Slate).
Container: A clean white card with rounded corners (24px) and a very subtle shadow.

3. Technical Requirements (MVP Implementation)
Library Choice: Use Recharts (standard for React) or Chart.js via react-chartjs-2.
Data Structure: An array of objects where each object contains the dimension, userScore, and benchmarkScore.
Responsiveness: The chart must scale its radius based on the screen width to avoid label clipping on mobile.
Tooltips: On hover, show exact numerical values for both "Your Company" and "Peer Benchmark".


## Multi-Dimensional Radar Chart (MVP) — Final Spec

### 1) Content & Wording (Copy)

**Main Header**
- The Multi-Dimensional Maturity Profile

**Sub-headline**
- A high-fidelity visualization comparing your organizational performance across 7 core dimensions against the industry average.

**Dimensions (7 axes)**
- Strategy
- People
- Data
- Use Cases
- Processes
- Compliance
- Tech

**Legend**
- **Your Company**: user series
- **Peer Benchmark**: average of **500+ companies** (benchmark series)

### 2) Design & UI (Card + Chart)

**Container**
- White card
- Rounded corners: **24px**
- Very subtle shadow

**Chart type**
- Radar / Spider chart

**Palette**
- **User series**: soft red stroke + semi-transparent fill `rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.2)`
- **Benchmark series**: soft blue stroke + semi-transparent fill `rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.2)`

**Grid**
- Concentric rings (circular or polygonal)
- Scale: **1 to 5**
- Light gray grid lines

**Typography**
- Labels outside the perimeter
- Clean sans-serif, charcoal/slate tone

### 3) Technical Requirements (MVP)

**Library**
- Recharts (preferred) **or** Chart.js via `react-chartjs-2`

**Data model**
- Array of 7 objects:

```json
[
    { "dimension": "Strategy", "userScore": 3.2, "benchmarkScore": 2.8 },
    { "dimension": "People", "userScore": 2.6, "benchmarkScore": 2.4 }
]
```

* Score range: **1–5** (consistent with cluster scale)

**Responsiveness**

* Radar radius must scale with screen width
* Must avoid label clipping on mobile (reduce radius / adjust label offset)

**Tooltips**

* Hover shows exact numeric values for both series:

* Your Company: X.X
* Peer Benchmark: X.X
