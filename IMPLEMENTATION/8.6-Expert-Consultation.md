Expert Consultation 
1. Content & Wording (Copywriting)
Main Section Header: "Expert Consultation & Next Steps"
Section Subheadline: "Transitioning from a digital report to human-led transformation."
Card Title: "Book Your Results Deep-Dive" (Include calendar icon).
Main Body Text: "Every SME journey is unique. Schedule a 30-minute debrief with an AI Compass strategist to walk through these results, validate the roadmap against your current budget, and identify the 'Low-Hanging Fruit' specific to your industry."
CTA Button: "Schedule Consultation →"
Footer Bullet Points:
30-minute session
Industry-specific insights
Budget validation

2. Design & UI Specifications
Background: The section background remains neutral (pearl-white), while the card itself features a vibrant gradient from Blue (#3B82F6) to Purple (#A855F7).
Transparency: The central text is housed in a slightly darkened, semi-transparent overlay to ensure high readability against the gradient.
Typography: White text for all elements inside the card to contrast with the gradient.
Button: Solid white background with blue/purple primary text. Subtle hover animation (lifting effect).
Card Shadow: Large, soft shadow to create depth and emphasis as the final call-to-action on the page.

3. Technical Requirements (MVP Implementation)
Interactive CTA: The button should link to an external scheduling tool like Calendly or open a lead-capture modal.
Responsive Layout: On mobile, the footer bullets should wrap or become a vertical list, and the main card padding should decrease to maximize screen real estate.
Accessibility: Ensure the white text on the gradient background maintains a high contrast ratio for accessibility compliance.
