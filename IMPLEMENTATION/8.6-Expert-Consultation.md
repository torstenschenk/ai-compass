Footer Bullet Points:
30-minute session
Industry-specific insights
Budget validation

2. Design & UI Specifications
Background: The section background remains neutral (pearl-white), while the card itself features a vibrant gradient from Blue (#3B82F6) to Purple (#A855F7).
Transparency: The central text is housed in a slightly darkened, semi-transparent overlay to ensure high readability against the gradient.
Typography: White text for all elements inside the card to contrast with the gradient.
Button: Solid white background with blue/purple primary text. Subtle hover animation (lifting effect).
Card Shadow: Large, soft shadow to create depth and emphasis as the final call-to-action on the page.

3. Technical Requirements (MVP Implementation)
Interactive CTA: The button should link to an external scheduling tool like Calendly or open a lead-capture modal.
Responsive Layout: On mobile, the footer bullets should wrap or become a vertical list, and the main card padding should decrease to maximize screen real estate.
Accessibility: Ensure the white text on the gradient background maintains a high contrast ratio for accessibility compliance.
