1. Content & Wording
The objective is to move from raw data to "Decision Intelligence." The wording must be sharp, diagnostic, and prioritize the two most impactful findings.
Component Header:
Headline: Strategic Gap Analysis
Sub-headline: Identifying the "Delta" between your current position and the next level.
Card 1: The Talent Gap (People & Culture)
Context: Used when a high Delta exists between Leadership Strategy and Workforce Readiness.
Status Quo Text: "While your leadership has a clear vision, there is a disconnect with the operational workforce. 65% of your responses indicate a 'Cautious' mindset toward AI."
Strategic Risk: "Without addressing psychological safety and upskilling, your technical tools will lack the adoption needed for ROI."
Badge: HIGH
Card 2: The Compliance Vulnerability (Governance & Ethics)
Context: Used when high-weight checklist items (like AI Policy or Code of Conduct) are missing.
Status Quo Text: "Your technical velocity is outpacing your oversight. The lack of a defined 'AI Code of Conduct' creates significant long-term legal and reputational risks."
Strategic Risk: "Specifically regarding upcoming EU AI Act requirements, the absence of governance poses a critical liability to scaling operations."
Badge: CRITICAL

2. Design & UI SpecificationsThe design focuses on "Risk Awareness."
It should feel different from the Maturity Profile by using warmer, alert-driven colors.
Layout:Container: Two stacked horizontal cards (Flexbox/Grid).
Spacing: $24\text{px}$ gap between cards; 
$32\text{px}$ padding inside cards.
Visual Elements using Icons

3. Technical Requirements (MVP Implementation)
The "Logic Engine" must execute the two-stage logic defined in the objective.
Stage 1: Statistical Analysis ($Z$-Scores)
Formula: $Z = (x - \mu) / \sigma$ (where $x$ is the user's score, $\mu$ is peer mean, $\sigma$ is peer std dev).
Detection: Flag any dimension where $Z < -1.2$.
Prioritization: If multiple dimensions are flagged, select the one with the largest Delta to the "Strategy" dimension.
Stage 2: Weighted Checklist Logic
Data Source: checklist_items table with columns [item_id, status (boolean), question_weight (integer)].
Execution: Filter for status = False. Sort by question_weight descending.
Output: Select the top item as the second gap (typically Compliance or Data Governance).
LLM Prompt for Dynamic Synthesis:Input Variables: {{dimension_scores}}, {{top_missing_checklist_items}}, {{industry_benchmarks}}.Constraint: "Generate exactly 2 gaps. 
Use the 'Status Quo vs. Strategic Risk' format. Limit each description to 30 words to prevent UI overflow."
