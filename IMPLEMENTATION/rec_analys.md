# AI-Compass: "Next Best Action" Tactical Roadmap
### Strategic Rationale
Static scores tell you where you are. A **Strategic Roadmap** tells you how to grow. 

**This notebook implements a Hybrid Success Pathway:**
1.  **Success Trajectory (k-NN)**: We don't just find random neighbors; we find "Lookalikes" who are **15-30% more mature**. They represent the "Future You".
2.  **Thematic Weighted Gap Analysis**: We analyze the "Tactical Headers" (e.g., 'Leadership Alignment') and expert weights to find high-ROI actions.
3.  **Phased Roadmap**: We organize recommendations into a logical chronological flow:
    -   **Phase 1: Foundation** (Strategy, Data, Culture)
    -   **Phase 2: Implementation** (Infrastructure, Use Cases)
    -   **Phase 3: Optimization** (Processes, Governance)

## 1. SUCCESS DATA PREPARATION

## 2. HYBRID ROADMAP GENERATION

## 3. NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS (LLM-READY)

## 4. VISUALIZING THE HORIZON

## 5. Strategic Conclusion: From Map to Motion

### 1. Moving Beyond Static Scores
A maturity score is a snapshot in time. The **Strategic Roadmap** transforms this snapshot into a three-dimensional transformation path. By using k-NN lookalikes, we provide proof-of-concept for the user's future: "Companies like yours, who are already 20% more mature, prioritized these specific themes."

### 2. The ROI of Sequencing
The most common mistake in AI adoption is skipping the 'Foundation' (Phase 1) to jump into 'Use Cases' (Phase 2). This roadmap enforces a logical structure that ensures technical readiness matches business ambition.

### 3. Next Steps for Consultants
Use this roadmap to guide the next 6-12 months of the client's development. Update the data every quarter to track "Progression toward Horizon" and adjust the tactical priorities as the organization matures.
