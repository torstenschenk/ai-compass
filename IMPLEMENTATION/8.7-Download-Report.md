PDF Download Module

1. Content & Wording (Copywriting)
Headline: "Download Your Complete Report" (Font: Bold Sans-Serif, Charcoal).
Sub-headline: "Get a comprehensive PDF version of your AI maturity assessment for offline review and team sharing." (Font: Regular Sans-Serif, Slate Gray).
CTA Button Text: "Download Full Report" (Include leading download icon).
Value Propositions (Features List):
Complete Analysis: All sections with detailed insights.
Visual Charts: High-quality graphics included.
Shareable: Perfect for stakeholder meetings.

2. Design & UI Specifications (Nano Banana Style)
Container: A centered white card with a subtle outer glow/drop shadow (box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)).
Border Radius: 16px (Smooth, modern corners).
Spacing: Large internal padding (48px) to maintain a minimalist, high-end consulting feel.
Iconography:
Top Icon: Blue document icon inside a light-blue circular background (#EFF6FF).
Checkmarks: Green circular outline checkmarks (#22C55E).
Button Styling:
Background: Linear gradient from vibrant blue (#3B82F6) to purple (#A855F7).
Text: White, bold.
Hover State: Slight scale-up (1.02) and increased brightness.

3. Structural Hierarchy
Vertical Stack: [Top Icon] → [Headline] → [Sub-headline] → [CTA Button].
Horizontal Row (Bottom): A three-column grid containing the features (Complete Analysis | Visual Charts | Shareable). On mobile/small screens, this should reflow into a vertical list.

4. Technical Requirements for MVP Integration
A. Frontend Implementation:
Framework: Use a React/Next.js component with Tailwind CSS for rapid styling.
State Management: The "Download" button must trigger a function that collects the current session's assessment data (Cluster Name, Maturity Scores, Gap Analysis, and Roadmap).
B. PDF Generation Logic:
Library Recommendation: Use jspdf combined with html2canvas for client-side generation, or @react-pdf/renderer for a structured, server-side-style PDF layout.
Dynamic Data Injection: The PDF must not be a static file. It must dynamically inject:
The User's Maturity Score.
The Radar Chart (Visual Representation).
The Gap Analysis text generated by your notebook logic.
The Roadmap specific to their cluster.
C. Export Features:
Filename Convention: AI_Compass_Report_[CompanyName]_[Date].pdf.
Resolution: Ensure charts are exported in high DPI (300) to prevent pixelation when printed.


# PDF Download CTA Module — Implementation Specs (MVP)

## Purpose
Provide a single, high-confidence call-to-action on the Results page to download the **dynamic** assessment PDF.

## 1) Copy (exact text)
- **Headline:** `Download Your Complete Report`
- **Sub-headline:** `Get a comprehensive PDF version of your AI maturity assessment for offline review and team sharing.`
- **CTA button:** `Download Full Report` (leading download icon)
- **Feature bullets (3):**
  - `Complete Analysis: All sections with detailed insights.`
  - `Visual Charts: High-quality graphics included.`
  - `Shareable: Perfect for stakeholder meetings.`

---

## 2) UI / Layout (Nano Banana)
- **Container:** centered white card with subtle glow/shadow  
  - `box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`
  - `border-radius: 16px`
  - `padding: 48px` (reduce on mobile)
- **Top icon:** blue document icon in light-blue circular background `#EFF6FF`
- **Checkmarks:** green circular outline checkmarks `#22C55E`
- **Button:**
  - background: gradient `#3B82F6 → #A855F7`
  - text: white, bold
  - hover: `scale(1.02)` + slightly brighter

### Structure
- Vertical stack: **[Icon] → [Headline] → [Sub-headline] → [CTA Button]**
- Bottom row: **3-column feature grid** (mobile: collapses into vertical list)

## 3) Data & Trigger Behavior (MVP)
### Frontend
- Component lives on Results page.
- CTA triggers **one action only**: start PDF download.
- While downloading/generating: show button state `Downloading…` and disable the button.

### Data source
- Use the **already-loaded** Results payload:
  - `GET /api/v1/assessments/{assessment_id}?token={access_token}`
- Do **not** re-run calculations in the client.

## 4) PDF Generation (MVP decision)
### Recommended for this project
**Server-side PDF endpoint** (consistent with your backend-first approach and deterministic reproducibility):

- `GET /api/v1/assessments/{assessment_id}/pdf?token={access_token}`
- Response headers:
  - `Content-Type: application/pdf`
  - `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="AI_Compass_Report_{CompanyName}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.pdf"`

**Client responsibility:** call the endpoint and download the blob.

### Why server-side for MVP
- Guarantees identical output regardless of browser/device.
- Easy to embed charts as images generated on backend.
- Avoids html2canvas quirks (fonts, DPI, layout drift).

## 5) Output Requirements
- **Filename convention:** `AI_Compass_Report_[CompanyName]_[Date].pdf`
- **Quality:** charts must be embedded at **print-safe resolution** (target 300 DPI equivalent).
- **Must include (minimum):**
  - Company snapshot + date + questionnaire version/hash
  - Overall score `2.6/5` + company cluster + percentile
  - Cluster profile visualization
  - Radar chart (7 dimensions)
  - Strategic Gap Analysis (2 items)
  - Roadmap (3 phases)
  - Footer versions: scoring_engine_version, ml_model_version, llm_prompt_version, llm_model_name

## 6) Error Handling
- If PDF endpoint fails:
  - show non-blocking error toast: `Download failed. Please try again.`
  - keep user on Results page (no navigation changes)
