PDF Download Module

1. Content & Wording (Copywriting)
Headline: "Download Your Complete Report" (Font: Bold Sans-Serif, Charcoal).
Sub-headline: "Get a comprehensive PDF version of your AI maturity assessment for offline review and team sharing." (Font: Regular Sans-Serif, Slate Gray).
CTA Button Text: "Download Full Report" (Include leading download icon).
Value Propositions (Features List):
Complete Analysis: All sections with detailed insights.
Visual Charts: High-quality graphics included.
Shareable: Perfect for stakeholder meetings.

2. Design & UI Specifications (Nano Banana Style)
Container: A centered white card with a subtle outer glow/drop shadow (box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)).
Border Radius: 16px (Smooth, modern corners).
Spacing: Large internal padding (48px) to maintain a minimalist, high-end consulting feel.
Iconography:
Top Icon: Blue document icon inside a light-blue circular background (#EFF6FF).
Checkmarks: Green circular outline checkmarks (#22C55E).
Button Styling:
Background: Linear gradient from vibrant blue (#3B82F6) to purple (#A855F7).

3. Structural Hierarchy
Vertical Stack: [Top Icon] → [Headline] → [Sub-headline] → [CTA Button].
Horizontal Row (Bottom): A three-column grid containing the features (Complete Analysis | Visual Charts | Shareable). On mobile/small screens, this should reflow into a vertical list.

4. Technical Requirements for MVP Integration
A. Frontend Implementation:
Framework: Use a React/Next.js component with Tailwind CSS for rapid styling.
State Management: The "Download" button must trigger a function that collects the current session's assessment data (Cluster Name, Maturity Scores, Gap Analysis, and Roadmap).
B. PDF Generation Logic:
Library Recommendation: Use jspdf combined with html2canvas for client-side generation, or @react-pdf/renderer for a structured, server-side-style PDF layout.
Dynamic Data Injection: The PDF must not be a static file. It must dynamically inject:
The User's Maturity Score.
The Radar Chart (Visual Representation).
The Gap Analysis text generated by your notebook logic.
The Roadmap specific to their cluster.
C. Export Features:
Filename Convention: AI_Compass_Report_[CompanyName]_[Date].pdf.
Resolution: Ensure charts are exported in high DPI (300) to prevent pixelation when printed.
